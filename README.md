# gesturecontrol-projector

### TODO:
 - [ ] Make the overlay window work in its own thread non-blocking so that inputs from the camera get processed even when the overlay window is rendering
 - [ ] Make a more robust overlay window for rendering the User actions
 - [ ] Make sure the overlay circles aren't shown when the hands are ouside of the screen
 - [ ] interconnect the overlay with the actual mouse control service more
 - [ ] Implement a presentation mode
 - [ ] For presenation mode it might make sense to use selenium, or to get it going with simulating "next" and "previous" buttons usually used for music control
