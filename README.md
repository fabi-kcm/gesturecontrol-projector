### TODO:
 - [x] Make the overlay window work in its own thread non-blocking so that inputs from the camera get processed even when the overlay window is rendering
 - [ ] refractor perform_onscreen_actions.py so that it actually ues the new cool wonderful amazing reworked filterapp.py (I'm excited!)
 - [(x)] TEST Make a more robust overlay window for rendering the User actions
 - [(x)] TEST Make sure the overlay circles aren't shown when the hands are ouside of the screen
 - [ ] Implement a presentation mode
 - [ ] For presenation mode it might make sense to use selenium, or to get it going with simulating "next" and "previous" buttons usually used for music control
